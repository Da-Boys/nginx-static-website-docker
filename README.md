# Deploy Static Website using Nginx in Docker

## üìå Project Description
This project demonstrates how to deploy a static HTML website using *Nginx* inside a Docker container.  
The HTML files are cloned from GitHub and served via Nginx, with the container accessible from the browser using a mapped port.  
The Dockerfile used for building the image is located at [codes/Dockerfile](codes/Dockerfile).
